# the output of these 3 options is overwritten at every cycle (sample) --> make it write separately for each sample
# the option <--outputstats> generates GBs of output and it may be too much to have one for each sample
# I can't find <--outputstats> in the v2.x, it probably was substituted by <--settings>
# the output can be zipped on the fly, so I may still use <--settings> for each sample in v2.x

## I don't get why this tool works in bio4, given that I did not install it and just copy the executable (~/tools/AdapterRemoval)


## make it work on fastq.gz on the fly
